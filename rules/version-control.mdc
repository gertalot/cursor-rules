# Version Control Rules

- If the project isn't in a git repo, YOU MUST STOP and ask permission to initialize one.
- YOU MUST STOP and ask how to handle uncommitted changes or untracked files when starting work.
  Suggest committing existing work first.
- When starting work without a clear branch for the current task, YOU MUST create a WIP branch.
- YOU MUST TRACK All non-trivial changes in git.
- YOU MUST commit frequently throughout the development process, even if your high-level tasks are not yet done.
- NEVER SKIP OR EVADE OR DISABLE A PRE-COMMIT HOOK
