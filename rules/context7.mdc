# Context7 Rule

## Mandatory Usage

- **Always** use Context7 (the MCP server) for:
  - Library, framework, and tool documentation
  - Best practices, recommended patterns, and up-to-date syntax

## Requirements

- For every coding, configuration, or architectural task, you **must** consult Context7 for the latest best practicesâ€”even if you already know the answer.
- **Do not** rely solely on your own training or memory for best practices, syntax, or recommendations.
- If a user requests a solution, you **must** check Context7 for the most current, authoritative answer before proceeding.
- If no best practice or up-to-date answer is found in Context7, you **must** state this explicitly in your response.

## Purpose

Ensure all code, configuration, and advice is always based on the latest, most authoritative, and up-to-date information.

## Enforcement

- This rule overrides all other documentation and best practice rules.
- Failing to use Context7 or not checking for the latest best practices is a critical error.
