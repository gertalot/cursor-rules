# Execute rule

## Context

This rule is used when the LLM agent needs to implement a story from an implementation backlog. Example:

```txt
@execute.mdc @my-shopping-cart-backlog.md story 1
```

The backlog document contains instructions for you to implement a story. Explanation of a backlog story structure (don't
do anything yet, this is just for your understanding):

- Under the story heading, there is a description of what the story is about
- **Verification Criteria** must be met for the story to be complete. The criteria can be measured with passing tests or
  functionality.
- **Test cases** are automated tests that must pass for the story to be complete
- **Implementation** contains step-by-step instructions for you that implement part of the story

---

## Process

1. **Context**: Read the context documents and the backlog document. If you think anything else is relevant, read that
   also
2. **Story**: Read the story specified by the user (e.g. "story 1") in the backlog.
3. **Make a plan**: Look at the story and go over each of the verification criteria, test cases, and implementation steps.
   - Use context7 and web search to make sure you have the most up-to-date information (don't assume you already know).
   - Think really hard! You must implement the story requirements with high quality code, minimal changes, and with the
     simplest solutions that follow best practice.
4. **Approval**: Explain what you will do, what changes you will make and what code will be affected.
   **WAIT FOR APPROVAL FROM Big Boss!** This is **CRITICAL**: Do **NOT** start implementation until you have approval.
5. **Implementation**: for each implementation step in the story:
   1. All **linting**, **type checking**, and **testing** MUST pass. If not, iterate and try again.
   2. On completion of the step, verify that the step is complete, tell Big Boss that the step is complete, and mark
      the step as complete in the backlog document before moving to the next step.
6. **Story Completion**: When all steps are complete, go back to the "Verification Criteria" and "Test Cases" sections
   1. Ensure all test cases are implemented and passing. Mark each test that is implemented and passing as done. If any
      tests are not implemented or not passing, tell Big Boss and wait for instructions: You'll have to fix them
      before we can complete.
   2. For each verification criterion, make sure that is is satisfied, and then mark as done. If not all verification
      criteria are satisfied, tell Big Boss and ask for instructions.
