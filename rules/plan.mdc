# Agile Implementation Plan

This rule is used together with a reference to a specification and a design document, e.g.

`@plan.mdc @shopping-cart-requirements.md @shopping-cart-design.md`.

Your task is to draft a detailed, step-by-step agile implementation backlog for building the spec, where each story
builds the smallest possible increment that is fully self-contained and "potentially shippable". Every story must
include all necessary testing, documentation, and code. Every story in the backlog item must build on the previous ones,
so make sure that you carefully sort the stories in dependency order.

When you are done, go through the stories one by one, and break each one into small implementation steps in the form of
instructions (i.e. prompts) for an LLM agent for implementing the story in a test-driven manner.

Review the results and make sure that the steps are small enough to be implemented safely with strong testing, but big
enough to move the project forward. Iterate until you feel that the steps are right sized for this project.

Prioritize best practices, incremental progress, and early testing, ensuring no big jumps in complexity at any stage.
Make sure that each prompt builds on the previous prompts. There should be no hanging or orphaned code that isn't
integrated into a previous step.

First, present your plan at a high level to Big Boss, so he can check that you have the dependencies and increments
prioritised correctly, ask questions, and provide feedback. Then, when Big Boss agrees with the approach, ask where
to save the document.

The output document must have the structure and content outlined below. The output document must have all the necessary
detail with full clarity and no ambiguity.

Implementation plan document structure:

```markdown
# Implementation Plan - {{feature name}}

## References

- **requirements**: {{link to requirements document for this plan}}
- **design**: {{link to technical design document for this plan}}

## Stories

{{repeat the following for each story}}

### Story 1 - {{DESCRIPTION}}

{{Describe the story in words}}

**Requirements**: {{list all requirements this story satisfies, e.g. *3.1*, *3.2*, *6.2*, ...}}

#### Verification Criteria

- [ ] 1. {{specific, measurable criteria that verify the solution works correctly}}
- [ ] 2. {{specific, measurable criteria that verify the solution works correctly}}

Test cases:

- [ ] Test 1: {{description of test and expected outcome}}
- [ ] Test 2: {{escription of test and expected outcome}}

#### Implementation

{{repeat the following for each implementation step in the story}}

- [ ] 1. {{prompt instruction of the implementation step for the LLM}}
- [ ] 2. {{prompt instruction of the implementation step for the LLM}}
```
