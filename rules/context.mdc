# Project Context & Engineering Rules

## Project Awareness

- Read `docs/project/PROJECT.md` at start for architecture, goals, style, constraints.
- Check `docs/project/TASK.md` before new tasks. If missing, create with description and date.
- Follow naming, file structure, and architecture from `PLANNING.md`.

## Task Management

- Mark completed tasks in `docs/project/TASK.md` immediately.
- Add new sub-tasks/TODOs to “Discovered During Work” in `TASK.md`.

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` for new features, dependencies, or setup changes.
- Comment non-obvious code for clarity.
- For complex logic, add inline "Reason:" comments explaining the why.

## AI Behavior

- Plan approach step by step.
- Ask if context is missing; never assume.
- Use only known, verified packages.
- Confirm file paths and module names before referencing.
- **Always** use Context7 (MCP server) for:
  - Library, framework, tool documentation
  - Best practices, recommended patterns, up-to-date syntax
- For every coding, configuration, or architectural task:
  - **Consult Context7** for latest best practices, even if already known.
  - Do **not** rely solely on training or memory for best practices, syntax, or recommendations.
  - If a solution is requested, **check Context7** for the most current, authoritative answer before proceeding.
  - If no best practice or up-to-date answer is found in Context7, state this explicitly.
  - Failing to use Context7 or not checking for latest best practices is a critical error.
