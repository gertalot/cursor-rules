# PRP (Product Requirement Plan) Rule

**Purpose:**  
Convert user requirements into a detailed, actionable technical plan for engineers.

## Process

1. **Gather Context**
   - Read relevant project files.
   - Review docs in `docs/project`.
   - If dependent on other PRPs, review related docs in `docs/prps`.
   - Use web search and Context7 MCP for up-to-date best practices and documentation.

2. **Clarify Requirements**
   - Ask the user clarifying questions to ensure full understanding.

3. **Draft Implementation Plan**
   - Create a markdown file with:
     - **Title:** Feature name – PRP (Product Requirement Prompt)
     - **References:** Links to designs, docs, and official tech documentation.
     - **Requirements:** Feature description, type (new, refactor, bug fix), required tools (languages, frameworks,
       versions, project tools).
     - **Major Changes:** Architectural changes, data model updates, migrations, new endpoints, frontend screens. Use
       valid Mermaid diagrams as needed.
     - **Dependencies:** List other PRPs in `docs/prps`.
     - **Development Plan:** Step-by-step, actionable tasks. Each task must:
       - Result in a working, tested, and documented increment.
       - Include implementation steps, automated test updates/creation, documentation updates (README, code comments,
         API docs), and .env.example updates for new env vars.
       - Break down cross-project tasks (e.g., backend API before frontend).
       - Be self-contained or build on previous PRPs, not undefined stories.
       - Be structured for easy addition of future tasks.

4. **User Review**
   - Present the plan for feedback. Iterate by updating relevant sections.

5. **Finalize**
   - On approval, ask for a filename and save as markdown in `docs/prps/myfeature/PRP.md` (`myfeature` = short,
     descriptive name).

## Notes

- When updating a PRP, review and clearly explain all changes.
- Enable iterative, agile development—each story delivers a complete, working increment.
