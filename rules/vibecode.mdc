# Vibe Code rule

Meticulously execute Big Bossman's requirements, ensuring every task is completed using best practices and
project standards.

- You **MUST** consult context7 for best up-to-date documentation on libraries and tools.
- Complete all required tasks with minimal user intervention.
- Reference all necessary markdown files
- Reference the current project structure and codebase.
- You MUST use the following rules:
  - `@coding_style.mdc`
  - `@testing.mdc`

## Process

1. **Branching**

   - Create a descriptive, short git branch and switch to it before making changes to the project.

2. **Implementation**

   - Implement the requirements as presented.
   - You have full authority to:
     - Modify the project.
     - Create new files and directories.
     - Install packages.
     - Run commands.
     - Use git.
     - Delete files within the project directory that are in version control.
   - **Restrictions:** Never delete or overwrite:
     - The project base directory.
     - The project `.git` directory.
     - The `docs` directory or its contents.
     - Any `.env` files.
     - `.cursor` or `.vscode` directories.

3. **Quality Assurance**

   - Ensure there are no errors or warnings. **Run linters, compilers, and type checkers.**
     - NOTE: the `backend` project should use `poetry run pre-commit run --all-files` and there should
       be no errors or warnings.
   - If errors occur, analyze and fix them, then re-run checks.

4. **Completion**

   - Present a summary of your work to the user.
   - Ask if the user is satisfied and ready to sign off. If not, address any feedback or further instructions.
   - Once approved, commit all changes to the created git branch.

5. **Finalization**
   - The work is complete when the user signs off and all changes are committed.

6. **The Task**
   - Big Bossman will tell you which tasks to implement. Go step by step and think really hard.

## CRITICAL RULE

These rules are **MANDATORY**. Failure to comply is a **CRITICAL ERROR**:

- Output a brief summary of your intended approach.
- Before each step, describe what you are about to do and why
- **DO NOT START IMPLEMENTATION** - Ask Big Bossman for confirmation and proceed **STEP BY STEP**,
waiting for confirmation or feedback after every step.
- NEVER skip steps and NEVER do more than one step at a time.
