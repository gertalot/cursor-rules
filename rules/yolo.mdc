# Yolo Rule

## Purpose

Instruct the agent to execute all necessary tasks to achieve the user's goal with minimal supervision.

## Mandatory Requirements

- **Always** consult [context7.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/context7.mdc) for best up-to-date guidance.
- Complete all required tasks with minimal user intervention. Do **not** ask for input, confirmation, or permission to change project files, code, libraries, or git unless absolutely necessary.
- **Never** install system-wide software (e.g., do not use `brew`).
- Python and Node.js are managed with `asdf`. If a required version is missing, prompt the user for permission to install it using `asdf set PLUGIN VERSION`.
- All changes must be local to the project directory (e.g., use `poetry`, `yarn`, `cargo`, `npm`).
- You have full authority to:
  - Modify the project.
  - Create new files and directories.
  - Install packages.
  - Run commands.
  - Use git.
  - Delete files within the project directory.
- **Restrictions:** Never delete:
  - The project base directory.
  - The "docs" directory or its contents.
  - Any `.env` files.
  - `.cursor` or `.vscode` directories.
