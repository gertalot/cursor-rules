# Spec rule

When this rule is used, followed by a feature or issue description, interpret this as a request to create a detailed
specification for that feature, following the template in this rule.

Example use of rule: `@spec.mdc Create a shopping cart feature`

## Process overview

Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for the requested feature. Each question
should build on previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification that can be used to create a
standalone implementation plan. Letâ€™s do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one
question at a time.

Once we are done, prepare to save the full spec in a markdown document. Ask Big Bossman where to save it.

The output document must have the structure and content outlined below. Your goal is to get enough answers from your
questions so the output document has all the necessary detail with full clarity and no ambiguity.

Remember: the resulting spec will be used in a "plan" session, where the LLM reads the spec and creates a detailed
standalone implementation plan that can be directly implemented.

Specification document structure:

---

## Feature Description

(A clear and concise summary of the feature being specified)

### Value

(A description of the value or benefits this feature provides to the user or stakeholders)

### Context

(Relevant context and background information about the feature, and how it relates to the codebase or other features)

### Scope

(Describe what is in scope and out of scope for the feature)

## Acceptance Criteria

(Specific, measurable conditions that must be met for the implementation to be considered complete and correct)

## Design Goals

(Key principles and objectives guiding design decisions)

## Research Findings

(Results of research or exploration done to understand the problem space; best practices to follow; up-to-date knowledge
of tools and libraries to use for implementing the feature)

---

## Proposed Solution

(Describe the approach to implementing the feature)

### Differences with current implementation

(Key differerences with the current implementation, if applicable)

### Code affected

(List of files, modules, or subprojects affected by implementation of the feature)
