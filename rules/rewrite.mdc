# Rewrite Rule

## Purpose

Enhance a markdown document or prompt for clarity, quality, and efficiency, optimizing it as instructions for a large language model.

## Instructions

- Strictly follow all explicit user requests and consider prior actions.
- The rewritten document must:
  - Preserve all requirements and technical details from the original.
  - Include all essential code patterns, tasks, and architectural decisions.
  - Be thorough and precise for consumption by large language models.
- Improve:
  - Structure
  - Clarity and conciseness
  - Token efficiency (minimize tokens without losing detail)

## Output Format

- Output the entire rewritten document as preformatted markdown.
- Use triple backticks and specify `markdown` (i.e., start with ```markdown and end with ```).
- **MANDATORY:**
  - Output nothing outside the code block.
  - Output only the rewritten document as a text block.
  - Failure to follow these rules is a critical error.
